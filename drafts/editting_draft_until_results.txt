Integrative Radiogenomics Using MRI Radiomics and Microarray Gene Expression Analysis to Predict Pathological Complete Response in Patients with Breast Cancer Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy

Abstract 
Objectives: Given the variable pathological complete response (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with breast cancer, identifying predictive markers is crucial. This study evaluated the predictive accuracy of three machine learning-based models: (1) radiomics using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, (2) genomics based on DNA microarray data, and (3) radiogenomics integrating both MRI and microarray data to predict pCR after NAC across all breast cancer subtypes. This study aimed to determine which model provides the most precise non-invasive prediction by utilizing a consistent dataset and analytical pipeline.
Methods: In this retrospective study, 112 patients with breast cancer who underwent DNA microarray analysis and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI before receiving NAC at a single institution between July 2006 and November 2016 were classified into pCR (N = 21) and non-pCR (N = 91) groups. The prediction accuracy of pCR after NAC was evaluated for three models, each utilizing machine learning and repeated stratified nested cross-validation.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a significant global health concern, with both high morbidity and mortality rates among women [1,2]. Its diverse biochemical natures [3] lead to varied therapy responses. Therefore, the need for personalized treatment is increasing.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is crucial for breast cancer treatment, aiming for a pathological complete response (pCR) and favorable outcomes [4]. However, some patients have shown resistance, making it essential to provide alternative treatment options. Therefore, identifying patients unlikely to benefit from NAC is pivotal [5].
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is important for evaluating the pCR before and after NAC in patients with breast cancer [6-7]. However, its accuracy in predicting the treatment response varies [8-11]. Several studies have explored the potential of radiomics in predicting pCR [12-15]. Fan et al. identified 12 radiomic features associated with tumor response to NAC using 57 pre-NAC MRI scans [16]. Similarly, Zheng et al. showed that a nomogram combining radiomic signatures from the intratumoral and peritumoral regions with clinical characteristics could accurately predict pCR after NAC [17]. Additionally, some researchers have reported the value of radiomics in predicting pCR in patients with breast cancer using MRI [16,18-23], with reported areas under the curve (AUC) values of 0.64 [18], 0.76 [19], and 0.64 [21]. Conversely, gene expression analysis methods have developed over the past two decades, enabling the construction of recurrence prediction models based on gene expression in breast cancer tissues. However, their accuracy is reportedly insufficient to reliably identify patients who are less likely to achieve pCR [24], complicating the determination of NAC indications based solely on this technique. 
$$Epsilon-3$$To address the limitations of single-modality approaches, the field of radiogenomics has emerged, aiming to establish correlations between quantitative imaging phenotypes and genomic data. This integrative strategy seeks to provide a more comprehensive understanding of tumor biology non-invasively and enhance predictive accuracy for personalized medicine [A, C]. Previous studies have suggested that combining imaging features, particularly from MRI, with gene expression profiles can offer deeper insights into tumor characteristics and treatment responses in various cancers, including breast cancer. For instance, associations between DCE-MRI features and gene expression related to critical cellular pathways, such as cell cycle regulation, have been reported, and radiogenomic signatures have shown potential for prognostic stratification in breast cancer [A]. Early investigations also demonstrated that MRI-derived imaging traits could reflect global transcriptomic states and were associated with specific molecular subtypes and prognostic gene signatures in breast cancer. Such findings underscore the potential of radiogenomics to uncover imaging biomarkers that reflect underlying molecular alterations and to develop more robust predictive models by leveraging complementary information from both imaging and genomics.

%%Gamma-6%%To address these challenges, we hypothesized that integrating machine learning techniques with MRI and microarray gene expression data would improve pCR prediction after NAC.%/Gamma-6%/ $$Gamma-6, Gamma-6の対応と思いますが、Discussionに記載するべきと思います。$$To address these challenges in accurately predicting pCR with individual modalities, which represents a significant clinical gap in optimizing NAC strategies and personalizing patient care, we formulated our hypothesis. We hypothesized that by integrating machine learning techniques with both MRI-derived radiomic features (reflecting macroscopic tumor phenotypes) and microarray gene expression data (representing underlying molecular characteristics), we could achieve a more robust and accurate prediction of pCR after NAC. The added value of this radiogenomics approach lies in its potential to provide a more comprehensive tumor profile by synergistically combining these distinct yet complementary data sources, thereby offering superior predictive performance over models based on either radiomics or genomics alone.$/Gamma-6$/  
This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of an integrated approach, termed radiogenomics, for predicting pCR after NAC. We hope to identify the most reliable and robust method for predicting the response to NAC, which can inform future therapeutic strategies for personalized therapy in patients with breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Study Participants
This study was conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB number: 15567-10)%%Epsilon-2-2%%, and the requirement for informed consent was waived.%/Epsilon-2-2%/ $$Epsilon-2-2, Epsilon2-2への対応に該当と考えます。ただ、これはlimitationに書く内容のことであり、ここではもっとシンプルに記載する方が良いように思います。$$Given the retrospective nature of this research and the utilization of de-identified data, the requirement for individual patient informed consent was waived by the IRB, in accordance with national ethical guidelines. It is important to acknowledge that the retrospective design of this study inherently introduces potential limitations. These may include selection bias related to patient inclusion (e.g., availability of both MRI and microarray data), information bias from reliance on existing medical records, and the possibility of unmeasured confounding variables that could influence the outcomes. While efforts were made to mitigate these through a consistent data collection protocol for the included cohort, these factors should be considered when interpreting the generalizability of our findings. $/Epsilon-2-2$/  Prior to NAC, all patients underwent vacuum-assisted biopsy for histological examination. This retrospective study was conducted at our hospital between 2002 and 2016. The inclusion criteria were 184 patients who underwent NAC and had available microarray data, as shown in Figure 1. We excluded 72 patients due to the absence of an MRI examination, lack of preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI, or biopsy performed prior to MRI. This resulted in 112 patients eligible for the final analysis. These patients underwent gene expression analyses before NAC, and their breast cancer subtypes and other relevant characteristics were documented in their health records, as shown in Table 1. Among the enrolled patients, 91 (81.3%) were identified as non-pCR, while the remaining 21 (18.8%) achieved pCR after NAC. These patients received NAC as previously described [25,26] with some modifications. 
The majority of patients (102/112, 91.1%) received weekly Paclitaxel treatment followed by FEC75 chemotherapy. A smaller number (1/112, 0.9%) received weekly Paclitaxel followed by FEC74. Additionally, patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (9/112, 8.0%) received weekly Paclitaxel combined with Trastuzumab, followed by FEC75. The FEC portion of chemotherapy was sometimes modified or interrupted according to individual patient responses and tolerability.
It's important to note that in some cases, the FEC portion of the regimen was interrupted or modified based on individual patient responses and tolerability.

From 2002 to 2016, 184 patients with breast cancer who received preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and had DNA expression microarray data available were enrolled. Patients were excluded if they did not undergo MRI examination or if a biopsy was performed prior to MRI (N = 72/184, 39.1%). The final analysis included 112 eligible patients, classified into pathological complete response (pCR, N = 21/112, 18.8%) and non-pCR (N = 91/112, 81.3%).

Histological Evaluation of the Response to Chemotherapy
Surgical specimens were cut into 5-mm slices, and hematoxylin and eosin-stained 3-μm sections were prepared to determine the presence or absence of tumor cells. Pathological diagnoses were performed by a pathologist with 8 years of experience. The complete disappearance of invasive tumor cells in the breast and negative lymph nodes was defined as pCR [27], regardless of the presence or absence of ductal carcinoma in situ in the breast.
Microarray Features
As described in previous studies [25,26], RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) from core-needle tumor biopsy samples obtained using the Mammotome (Mammotome 8G; HH Ethicon Endosurgery/Johnson and Johnson Company, Langhorne, PA) and analyzed using a DNA microarray (Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Array; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The presence of tumor cells in these samples was confirmed histologically in adjacent tumor biopsy samples. The extracted RNA (50 ng) was subjected to second-strand combinational DNA (cDNA) generation and amplification using random primers (WT-Ovation FFPE RNA Amplification System V2; NuGEN, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA). The amplified cDNA was then biotinylated, fragmented using the FL-Ovation cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGEN), and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif., USA) overnight (17 h) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After hybridization, the DNA microarray was stained for fluorescence using a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) and scanned using a Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). Microarray analysis of each case yielded 54,675 features.
MRI Protocol

Before NAC, patients underwent MRI using a 1.5T unit (Signa EXCITE HD EchoSpeed Plus; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) equipped with a 4-channel breast-array coil. The imaging protocol included one precontrast and four postcontrast-enhanced volumetric series captured at 94-second intervals to facilitate dynamic sequence analysis. Gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist; Bayer, Osaka, Japan) at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight was administered intravenously at a flow rate of 2 mL/s, followed by a 20 mL saline flush. The k-space's sequential view order was averaged over the scan time.
We used a T1-weighted fat-saturated three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence (VIBRANT: Volume Imaging for Breast Assessment; GE Healthcare) with the following parameters for the sagittal bilateral protocol: repetition time (TR) ranging from 6.3–6.5 ms; echo time (TE) ranging between 3.1–3.2 ms; in-plane resolution pixel sizes of 0.78 mm, without spacing between sections; flip angle of 10°; and a slice thickness of 2.0–2.6 mm in the slice direction. Additional parameters included a field of view of 20–22 cm and an acquisition matrix of 256×160.
MRI Features Extraction
For radiomic feature extraction, annotations were based on images captured 90 s after contrast in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. In cases with multiple tumors, the largest tumor was selected for detailed annotation. This task was manually performed by three radiologists from the radiology department with 2, 25, and 19 years of experience, respectively. %%Gamma-3%%During annotation, special attention was given to identifying and manually excluding areas of intratumoral hemorrhage. This segmentation, avoiding the hemorrhagic regions, defines the tumor volume of interest (VOI) for each patient.%/Gamma-3%/ $$Gamma-3, Gamma-3. これはLimitationに記載した方が良いです。$$To define the tumor volume of interest (VOI) for each patient, the three radiologists collaboratively delineated the tumor contours. They discussed any ambiguous areas and reached a consensus on the final VOI segmentation through this interactive process, aiming to minimize inter-observer variability. During annotation, special attention was given to identifying and manually excluding areas of intratumoral hemorrhage. While this collaborative consensus approach was employed, a quantitative assessment of inter-observer agreement (e.g., using metrics like the Dice similarity coefficient) was not performed in this study. Consequently, the manual nature of the segmentation, despite the discussion-based consensus, remains a potential source of variability that could influence the values of the extracted radiomic features. This is acknowledged as a limitation of the study.$/Gamma-3$/  
Using PyRadiomics version 2.2.0 (https://pypi.org/project/pyradiomics/2.2.0/), images were standardized, and 1,132 radiomic features were extracted from the VOI identified for each patient. %%Gamma-3%%Feature extraction was performed using settings from the official PyRadiomics YAML configuration file for MRI data with an approximately 3 mm slice thickness (URL: https://github.com/AIM-Harvard/pyradiomics/blob/39aaa77e588ea3539a2b081b880d84f19ff17e91/examples/exampleSettings/exampleMR_3mm.yaml).%/Gamma-3%/ $$Gamma-3$$The utilization of a standardized, open-source toolkit such as PyRadiomics promotes the reproducibility of feature computation from a defined VOI. Nevertheless, the reproducibility of the radiomic features can be influenced by the aforementioned potential variability in VOI delineation, as well as variations in image acquisition protocols or reconstruction parameters. A specific quantitative analysis of feature reproducibility against such variations (e.g., via test-retest imaging or VOI perturbation analysis) was not conducted within this research. To enhance the robustness and consistency of the extracted features, we adhered to standardized image preprocessing steps, including image normalization and resampling to a uniform voxel size (detailed in the following paragraph), and utilized the official PyRadiomics YAML configuration file for feature extraction. Feature extraction was performed using settings from the official PyRadiomics YAML configuration file for MRI data with an approximately 3 mm slice thickness (URL: https://github.com/AIM-Harvard/pyradiomics/blob/39aaa77e588ea3539a2b081b880d84f19ff17e91/examples/exampleSettings/exampleMR_3mm.yaml).$/Gamma-3$/ 
Features were extracted from both original and processed images with Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filters with sigma values of 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0, and wavelet filters (resulting in eight wavelet decompositions). The extracted features included morphological (14), histogram (234), and texture-based (884) features. Morphological features were calculated from segmented images, whereas histogram-based and textural features were calculated from both original and filtered images.
The images were normalized to a scale of 100 and resampled to a voxel size of 2 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm using B-spline interpolation. A bin width of five was used for image discretization. A voxel array shift of 300 was applied to ensure that most voxel values were positive. For further details on the parameter settings, please refer to the configuration file provided at the URL.
Construction of Machine Learning for the Predictive Model for pCR After NAC
We comprehensively evaluated the performance of three distinct models in predicting pCR after NAC in patients with breast cancer. The models are based on different datasets: (1) radiomics using MRI features, (2) genomics using DNA microarray data, and (3) radiogenomics integrating MRI features and microarray data. Each model's effectiveness was quantified using the area under the curve (AUC), and the optimal sensitivity and specificity values were determined using the Youden index.
Machine Learning Model Construction and Evaluation
We constructed machine learning models to predict pCR after NAC and assessed their accuracy using a repeated stratified nested cross-validation (CV) approach. $$Epsilon-2-1$$Regarding feature selection, for the radiomics model and the radiomics component of the radiogenomics model, all 1,132 features extracted via PyRadiomics were initially included, with the machine learning algorithm itself performing implicit feature weighting and selection through its training process. For the genomics model and the genomics component of the radiogenomics model, microarray data were first filtered to retain genes with a detection p-value < 0.01 in over 80% of cases; this step aimed to remove unreliably measured or low-expressed genes. If the number of remaining genes after this filtering exceeded 1,000, a random subset of 1,000 genes was selected. This random selection was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting, particularly given our sample size, and to ensure computational tractability for the subsequent modeling steps, while still aiming to capture a diverse representation of genomic information.
The Random Forest classifier was chosen as the specific machine learning algorithm for developing all predictive models. The rationale for selecting Random Forest includes its demonstrated robustness in handling high-dimensional datasets (common in radiomics and genomics), its ability to model complex non-linear relationships between features and outcomes, its inherent capability to provide feature importance scores, and its relatively good performance and reduced susceptibility to overfitting compared to some other algorithms, especially in studies with limited sample sizes. Furthermore, Random Forest has been widely and successfully applied in similar biomedical prediction tasks, including breast cancer outcome prediction.$/Epsilon-2-1$/  
We employed a 5-fold stratified cross-validation for both the outer and inner folds, which was repeated five times for the outer folds, where hyperparameters were tuned in the inner folds and prediction accuracies were evaluated on the data in the outer folds.
Our study aimed to compare the prediction accuracies of three distinct models: (1) radiomics using MRI features; (2) genomics using microarray data; and (3) radiogenomics combining microarray and MRI features.
The pipeline of algorithms used in this study is summarized in Table 2.

Microarray analysis was performed using R software (https://www.r-project.org/) and Bioconductor software (https://www.bioconductor.org/). All feature selections and machine learning algorithms were performed using Python (https://www.python.org/) and R. We calculated descriptive statistics using R. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.

Results
1.	Radiomics Model (MRI Features)
The radiomics model, which utilized MRI features, demonstrated an AUC of 0.563 (95% CI 0.410–0.718), indicating a moderate ability to differentiate between pCR and non-pCR patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 0.524 and 0.714, respectively. 
2.	Genomics Model (DNA Microarray Data)
The genomics model, based on DNA microarray data, showed a performance with an AUC of 0.559 (95% CI 0.379–0.722). This model showed a lower sensitivity of 0.571 but a higher specificity of 0.681 than the radiomics model. The genomic approach highlighted certain genomic features as key predictors of pCR.
3.	Radiogenomics Model (Integration of MRI and Microarray Data)
The radiogenomics model, which integrated both MRI and microarray data, %%Gamma-2%%produced the most significant results. This model achieved the highest AUC of 0.607 (95% CI, 0.438–0.758), along with a sensitivity of 0.619 and a specificity of 0.681. Termination of radiomic and genomic features resulted in a more comprehensive analysis, leading to improved prediction of pCR. The p-values for comparisons between the models were as follows: MRI (radiomics) vs. microarray (genomics), p = 0.973; MRI vs. MRI + Microarray (radiogenomics), p = 0.644; and microarray vs. MRI + Microarray, p = 0.232.%/Gamma-2%/ $$Gamma-2, Table3とFig.5のこと以外は考察で記載すると良いと思います。$$yielded a numerically higher area under the curve (AUC) of 0.607 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.438–0.758), with a sensitivity of 0.619 and a specificity of 0.681, when compared to the models using MRI features or microarray data alone (Table 3). This represented a modest numerical improvement in pCR prediction accuracy. However, this enhancement in AUC was not statistically significant when the radiogenomics model was compared to the radiomics model (p = 0.644) or the genomics model (p = 0.232). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed between the radiomics and genomics models (p = 0.973). These findings indicate that while integrating MRI and microarray data showed a slight trend towards improved prediction, the observed improvement was modest and did not reach statistical significance in this cohort. The specific features identified as important in this integrated model, encompassing both imaging and genetic markers, are presented in Figure 5. A detailed exploration of the potential biological relevance of these features and further discussion on the reasons for the modest improvement of the integrated model are provided in the Discussion section.$/Gamma-2$/
