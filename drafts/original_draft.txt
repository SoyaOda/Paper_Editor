Integrative Radiogenomics Using MRI Radiomics and Microarray Gene Expression Analysis to Predict Pathological Complete Response in Patients with Breast Cancer Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy

Abstract 
Objectives: Given the variable pathological complete response (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with breast cancer, identifying predictive markers is crucial. This study evaluated the predictive accuracy of three machine learning-based models: (1) radiomics using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, (2) genomics based on DNA microarray data, and (3) radiogenomics integrating both MRI and microarray data to predict pCR after NAC across all breast cancer subtypes. This study aimed to determine which model provides the most precise non-invasive prediction by utilizing a consistent dataset and analytical pipeline.
Methods: In this retrospective study, 112 patients with breast cancer who underwent DNA microarray analysis and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI before receiving NAC at a single institution between July 2006 and November 2016 were classified into pCR (N = 21) and non-pCR (N = 91) groups. The prediction accuracy of pCR after NAC was evaluated for three models, each utilizing machine learning and repeated stratified nested cross-validation.
Results: The radiogenomics model yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.607 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.438–0.758), outperforming both the radiomics (AUC 0.563, 95% CI: 0.410–0.718) and the genomics (AUC 0.559, 95% CI: 0.379–0.722) models. However, this improvement was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The p-values were used to compare the models: MRI (radiomics) vs. microarray (genomics), p = 0.97; MRI vs. MRI + Microarray (radiogenomics), p = 0.64; and microarray vs. MRI + Microarray, p = 0.23.
Conclusion: Machine learning-based radiogenomics, which combines MRI features and DNA microarray data, improved the accuracy of pCR prediction after NAC, although the improvement was not statistically significant.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a significant global health concern, with both high morbidity and mortality rates among women [1,2]. Its diverse biochemical natures [3] lead to varied therapy responses. Therefore, the need for personalized treatment is increasing.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is crucial for breast cancer treatment, aiming for a pathological complete response (pCR) and favorable outcomes [4]. However, some patients have shown resistance, making it essential to provide alternative treatment options. Therefore, identifying patients unlikely to benefit from NAC is pivotal [5].
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is important for evaluating the pCR before and after NAC in patients with breast cancer [6-7]. However, its accuracy in predicting the treatment response varies [8-11]. Several studies have explored the potential of radiomics in predicting pCR [12-15]. Fan et al. identified 12 radiomic features associated with tumor response to NAC using 57 pre-NAC MRI scans [16]. Similarly, Zheng et al. showed that a nomogram combining radiomic signatures from the intratumoral and peritumoral regions with clinical characteristics could accurately predict pCR after NAC [17]. Additionally, some researchers have reported the value of radiomics in predicting pCR in patients with breast cancer using MRI [16,18-23], with reported areas under the curve (AUC) values of 0.64 [18], 0.76 [19], and 0.64 [21]. Conversely, gene expression analysis methods have developed over the past two decades, enabling the construction of recurrence prediction models based on gene expression in breast cancer tissues. However, their accuracy is reportedly insufficient to reliably identify patients who are less likely to achieve pCR [24], complicating the determination of NAC indications based solely on this technique. To address these challenges, we hypothesized that integrating machine learning techniques with MRI and microarray gene expression data would improve pCR prediction after NAC.
This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of an integrated approach, termed radiogenomics, for predicting pCR after NAC. We hope to identify the most reliable and robust method for predicting the response to NAC, which can inform future therapeutic strategies for personalized therapy in patients with breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Study Participants
This study was conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB number: 15567-10), and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Prior to NAC, all patients underwent vacuum-assisted biopsy for histological examination. This retrospective study was conducted at our hospital between 2002 and 2016. The inclusion criteria were 184 patients who underwent NAC and had available microarray data, as shown in Figure 1. We excluded 72 patients due to the absence of an MRI examination, lack of preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI, or biopsy performed prior to MRI. This resulted in 112 patients eligible for the final analysis. These patients underwent gene expression analyses before NAC, and their breast cancer subtypes and other relevant characteristics were documented in their health records, as shown in Table 1. Among the enrolled patients, 91 (81.3%) were identified as non-pCR, while the remaining 21 (18.8%) achieved pCR after NAC. These patients received NAC as previously described [25,26] with some modifications. 
The majority of patients (102/112, 91.1%) received weekly Paclitaxel treatment followed by FEC75 chemotherapy. A smaller number (1/112, 0.9%) received weekly Paclitaxel followed by FEC74. Additionally, patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (9/112, 8.0%) received weekly Paclitaxel combined with Trastuzumab, followed by FEC75. The FEC portion of chemotherapy was sometimes modified or interrupted according to individual patient responses and tolerability.
It's important to note that in some cases, the FEC portion of the regimen was interrupted or modified based on individual patient responses and tolerability.

From 2002 to 2016, 184 patients with breast cancer who received preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and had DNA expression microarray data available were enrolled. Patients were excluded if they did not undergo MRI examination or if a biopsy was performed prior to MRI (N = 72/184, 39.1%). The final analysis included 112 eligible patients, classified into pathological complete response (pCR, N = 21/112, 18.8%) and non-pCR (N = 91/112, 81.3%). Data are presented as N (number of patients).

Histological Evaluation of the Response to Chemotherapy
Surgical specimens were cut into 5-mm slices, and hematoxylin and eosin-stained 3-μm sections were prepared to determine the presence or absence of tumor cells. Pathological diagnoses were performed by a pathologist with 8 years of experience. The complete disappearance of invasive tumor cells in the breast and negative lymph nodes was defined as pCR [27], regardless of the presence or absence of ductal carcinoma in situ in the breast.
Microarray Features
As described in previous studies [25,26], RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) from core-needle tumor biopsy samples obtained using the Mammotome (Mammotome 8G; HH Ethicon Endosurgery/Johnson and Johnson Company, Langhorne, PA) and analyzed using a DNA microarray (Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Array; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The presence of tumor cells in these samples was confirmed histologically in adjacent tumor biopsy samples. The extracted RNA (50 ng) was subjected to second-strand combinational DNA (cDNA) generation and amplification using random primers (WT-Ovation FFPE RNA Amplification System V2; NuGEN, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA). The amplified cDNA was then biotinylated, fragmented using the FL-Ovation cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGEN), and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif., USA) overnight (17 h) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After hybridization, the DNA microarray was stained for fluorescence using a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) and scanned using a Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). Microarray analysis of each case yielded 54,675 features.
MRI Protocol

Before NAC, patients underwent MRI using a 1.5T unit (Signa EXCITE HD EchoSpeed Plus; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) equipped with a 4-channel breast-array coil. The imaging protocol included one precontrast and four postcontrast-enhanced volumetric series captured at 94-second intervals to facilitate dynamic sequence analysis. Gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist; Bayer, Osaka, Japan) at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight was administered intravenously at a flow rate of 2 mL/s, followed by a 20 mL saline flush. The k-space's sequential view order was averaged over the scan time.
We used a T1-weighted fat-saturated three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence (VIBRANT: Volume Imaging for Breast Assessment; GE Healthcare) with the following parameters for the sagittal bilateral protocol: repetition time (TR) ranging from 6.3–6.5 ms; echo time (TE) ranging between 3.1–3.2 ms; in-plane resolution pixel sizes of 0.78 mm, without spacing between sections; flip angle of 10°; and a slice thickness of 2.0–2.6 mm in the slice direction. Additional parameters included a field of view of 20–22 cm and an acquisition matrix of 256×160.
MRI Features Extraction
For radiomic feature extraction, annotations were based on images captured 90 s after contrast in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. In cases with multiple tumors, the largest tumor was selected for detailed annotation. This task was manually performed by three radiologists from the radiology department with 2, 25, and 19 years of experience, respectively. During annotation, special attention was given to identifying and manually excluding areas of intratumoral hemorrhage. This segmentation, avoiding the hemorrhagic regions, defines the tumor volume of interest (VOI) for each patient.
Using PyRadiomics version 2.2.0 (https://pypi.org/project/pyradiomics/2.2.0/), images were standardized, and 1,132 radiomic features were extracted from the VOI identified for each patient. Feature extraction was performed using settings from the official PyRadiomics YAML configuration file for MRI data with an approximately 3 mm slice thickness (URL: https://github.com/AIM-Harvard/pyradiomics/blob/39aaa77e588ea3539a2b081b880d84f19ff17e91/examples/exampleSettings/exampleMR_3mm.yaml).
Features were extracted from both original and processed images with Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filters with sigma values of 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0, and wavelet filters (resulting in eight wavelet decompositions). The extracted features included morphological (14), histogram (234), and texture-based (884) features. Morphological features were calculated from segmented images, whereas histogram-based and textural features were calculated from both original and filtered images.
The images were normalized to a scale of 100 and resampled to a voxel size of 2 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm using B-spline interpolation. A bin width of five was used for image discretization. A voxel array shift of 300 was applied to ensure that most voxel values were positive. For further details on the parameter settings, please refer to the configuration file provided at the URL.
Construction of Machine Learning for the Predictive Model for pCR After NAC
We comprehensively evaluated the performance of three distinct models in predicting pCR after NAC in patients with breast cancer. The models are based on different datasets: (1) radiomics using MRI features, (2) genomics using DNA microarray data, and (3) radiogenomics integrating MRI features and microarray data. Each model's effectiveness was quantified using the area under the curve (AUC), and the optimal sensitivity and specificity values were determined using the Youden index.
Machine Learning Model Construction and Evaluation
We constructed machine learning models to predict pCR after NAC and assessed their accuracy using a repeated stratified nested cross-validation (CV) approach. We employed a 5-fold stratified cross-validation for both the outer and inner folds, which was repeated five times for the outer folds, where hyperparameters were tuned in the inner folds and prediction accuracies were evaluated on the data in the outer folds.
Our study aimed to compare the prediction accuracies of three distinct models: (1) radiomics using MRI features; (2) genomics using microarray data; and (3) radiogenomics combining microarray and MRI features.
The pipeline of algorithms used in this study is summarized in Table 2.
Step	Procedure	Description
1	Data preprocessing and feature selection	Radiomic features extracted using PyRadiomics. Microarray data were filtered to retain genes with detection p-value < 0.01 in >80% of cases. When gene count exceeded 1000, a random subset of 1000 genes was selected.
2	Classifier selection	Random Forest classifier used to predict pCR after NAC.
3	Hyperparameter tuning	Randomized search (RandomizedSearchCV) conducted with inner stratified 5-fold CV to optimize parameters: n_estimators (100–500), max_depth (None, 10–40), max_features (auto, sqrt, log2), and min_samples_split (2, 5, 10).
4	Model training and evaluation	Models trained using optimal hyperparameters derived from inner CV. Predictive accuracy validated using outer stratified 5-fold CV repeated five times.
5	Performance assessment	Model performance assessed by Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC). Sensitivity and specificity determined using Youden index.
6	Feature importance analysis	Importance scores calculated by mean decrease in impurity (Gini importance). Top 30 features identified for each model (MRI, Microarray, MRI+Microarray).

Statistics
Microarray analysis was performed using R software (https://www.r-project.org/) and Bioconductor software (https://www.bioconductor.org/). All feature selections and machine learning algorithms were performed using Python (https://www.python.org/) and R. We calculated descriptive statistics using R. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Each model's receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were calculated. A p-value <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

Results
1.	Radiomics Model (MRI Features)
The radiomics model, which utilized MRI features, demonstrated an AUC of 0.563 (95% CI 0.410–0.718), indicating a moderate ability to differentiate between pCR and non-pCR patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 0.524 and 0.714, respectively. 
2.	Genomics Model (DNA Microarray Data)
The genomics model, based on DNA microarray data, showed a performance with an AUC of 0.559 (95% CI 0.379–0.722). This model showed a lower sensitivity of 0.571 but a higher specificity of 0.681 than the radiomics model. The genomic approach highlighted certain genomic features as key predictors of pCR.
3.	Radiogenomics Model (Integration of MRI and Microarray Data)
The radiogenomics model, which integrated both MRI and microarray data, produced the most significant results. This model achieved the highest AUC of 0.607 (95% CI, 0.438–0.758), along with a sensitivity of 0.619 and a specificity of 0.681. Termination of radiomic and genomic features resulted in a more comprehensive analysis, leading to improved prediction of pCR. The p-values for comparisons between the models were as follows: MRI (radiomics) vs. microarray (genomics), p = 0.973; MRI vs. MRI + Microarray (radiogenomics), p = 0.644; and microarray vs. MRI + Microarray, p = 0.232.

Discussion
In this study, we evaluated three machine learning models—radiomics, genomics, and radiogenomics—to predict pCR after NAC in patients with breast cancer. The radiogenomics model, which combined MRI radiomic features with DNA microarray data, achieved the highest AUC of 0.607 (95% CI: 0.438–0.758) compared to the radiomics (AUC 0.563, 95% CI: 0.410–0.718) and genomics models (AUC 0.559, 95% CI: 0.379–0.722). Although the improvements were not statistically significant (p > 0.05), these results suggest that integrating imaging data with genomic data may enhance the predictive accuracy of pCR.
Radiogenomics has demonstrated significant potential for improving early detection, prognosis, and treatment selection by integrating imaging features with genomic data, thereby advancing the field of personalized medicine [28]. Recent advances in radiogenomics have demonstrated the potential to improve the prediction of treatment responses in patients with breast cancer. Zhang et al. demonstrated the utility of a radiogenomic model in predicting pCR in patients with triple-negative breast cancer [29]. Zhou et al. developed a preoperative radiogenomic model based on quantitative heterogeneity that effectively predicted both pCR and prognosis in patients with triple-negative breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy [30]. This was the first study to incorporate comprehensive gene expression data from microarrays into a radiogenomic model to enhance pCR prediction in all breast cancer subtypes. Our study provides new insights into the predictive performance of radiogenomics for pCR. 
We constructed machine learning models using MRI radiomic features and RNA expression profiles. These methods are consistent with the approach of Zheng et al., who integrated radiomic features with clinical characteristics to improve predictive accuracy [29]. Our study found that the radiogenomics model improved the performance of pCR prediction compared to the radiomics or genomics models. The analysis revealed that gene expression-related features were the top ones in the radiogenomic model, whereas MRI features also played an important role. These findings suggest that the combination of gene expression and MRI data contributes to improved pCR prediction.
First-order statistics and texture features processed using wavelet transforms and LoG filters are important in radiomics models. Features such as "wavelet-LLH_firstorder_RootMeanSquared" and "wavelet-HHL_glcm_ClusterShade" ranked highly. These features reflect intratumoral heterogeneity and structural irregularities, suggesting their utility in assessing treatment responsiveness.
In a genomic model, the expression of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, protein synthesis, and chromosome maintenance is important. Features such as GTF2I (general transcription factor IIi), SMC3 (structural maintenance of chromosomes 3), and EIF3A (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit A) ranked high. These proteins are known to play significant roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and genome stability and are closely linked to cancer development and progression.
In the radiogenomic model, genetic features from microarray data were predominant. Moreover, the MRI-derived features are less important. The "wavelet-LLH_firstorder_RootMeanSquared" feature, which was the most important in the MRI model, ranked fifth in the combined model. This may be due to the greater predictive power and information density of the microarray data compared to MRI data. Gene expression data directly reflects the biological characteristics of cancer, potentially increasing their importance in the model.
Interestingly, some of the top features in the radiomic and genomic models remained in the radiogenomic model, suggesting their consistent predictive importance. Simultaneously, new top-ranking features emerged in the radiogenomic model, indicating that integrating data types could lead to new predictive factors. Furthermore, radiomic and genomic models represent two independent predictive frameworks for NAC sensitivity. By combining these models with a radiogenomic approach, we harnessed potentially complementary information that may enhance the accuracy of pCR prediction. Increasing the number of cases and further validating our findings using external cohorts are essential to establish the statistical significance and generalizability of this synergistic approach.
Our study, while offering valuable insights, has some limitations. First, this was a retrospective study conducted at a single institution. Secondly, the sample size was relatively small, which may have affected the robustness of the results. Third, a potential selection bias existed, as the analysis was restricted to patients who received NAC and had available microarray data. Fourth, the segmentation method used for radiomic feature extraction may have influenced the results. Fifth, no external validation was performed, which is important for confirming the reliability of the results. Sixth, the NAC regimens used in our study reflected the standards at the time of data collection, which may differ from current standard regimens. Finally, our analysis included a combination of chemotherapy and targeted therapy with only a small number of patients (N=9/112, 8.0%) receiving trastuzumab. This could affect the relevance of our findings in contemporary clinical practice. 
Conclusion
This study demonstrated that radiogenomics—an integration of MRI-based radiomic features and gene expression profiles—showed the highest predictive performance for pathological complete response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Although the improvement was not statistically significant compared to radiomics or genomics alone, the findings suggest that combining imaging and molecular data may enhance prediction accuracy in a non-invasive manner. These results indicate that radiogenomics holds promise as a foundation for future, more personalized response prediction models in breast cancer management.
